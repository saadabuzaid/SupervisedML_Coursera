    "#### Linear regression:\n",
    "With linear regression, we are trying to build a model that is trying to recognise a numerical pattern with its given dataset (a set of data with features/inputs and actual outputs). This numerical pattern is a mathematical formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How can we know which formula to use?** \\\n",
    "This is where the machine learning comes in! The machine's objective is to learn what is the best mathematical to satisfy the output (y) with the given inputs/featues (x).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does satisfying the output mean?** \\\n",
    "It means predicting the actual output value in the dataset using its inputs/features, and it does the same for all entries (Xs & Y) in the dataset. The better the formula is at satsfying all data entries from your dataset, the better your model is.\n",

    "#### Classification:\n",
    "A Classification model will try to learn the best mathematical formula just like linear regression, but there is one difference. Linear regression will try to find a linear formual to satisfy outputs by predicting output value, but in a Classification model, the formula will by trying to draw a border line instead!\n",
    "This border line will create different zones in the graph, which are classes. Using features, if they fall into a specific zone, it means that they would be classified as the class/zone they fall in.\n",
